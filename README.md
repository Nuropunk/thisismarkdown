This is Markdown. 

The thing with "bad ui/ux". 

The thing that sucks for "non coders". 

To be honest this doesn't suck at all. It's pretty awesome. 

**I can bold stuff.**

*I can italicize.*

# I can make a huge header

###### Or a really small one

~~I can strikethrough~~

I could give you a bullet list too
* FUCK
* THE 
* LARPS

Or numbered if you prefer
1. CYPHERPUNKS
2. WRITE
3. CODE


> Block quotes? Yeah that's easy too

Even line breaks

`Highlights`

Or a table

Including emojis 🫡

You can even add links, like [The First Recursive Markdown Article](/content/2b565a977d2e6a2f18b7959b463bf6e8c351e85b8c1ae3372ba9b9dc1425100ai0)  

Or [A Cypherpunk's Manifesto](/content/8cb9a7f93677cc17a9f15acdd36ff368bf4efbf9cba6b77922c401f137e38025i0)
