This is Markdown. 

The thing with "bad ui/ux". 

The thing that sucks for "non coders". 

To be honest this doesn't suck at all. It's pretty awesome. 

**I can bold stuff.**

*I can italicize.*

# I can make a huge header

###### Or a really small one

~~I can strikethrough~~

I can make a bullet list too
* CYPHERPUNKS
* WRITE 
* CODE

Or numbered if I prefer
1. CYPHERPUNKS
2. WRITE
3. MARKDOWN


> Block quotes? Yeah that's easy too

Even line breaks

`Highlights`

Or a table
| CONS | PROS |
| --- | --- |
| ❌ | ✅ |

Emojis too 🫡

I can share my favorite ![art](/content/6a6296dfe1cd6c8d1e31b142656d5a3de3b646df83d34bc1e4aabb15ef7e8e89i0)

Or ![photograph](/content/2e9013e312a508702e886faf7e0b14eae2dcdbfe6526086dd1d2b0cafd93a6e5i0)  

I can add links, like [The First Recursive Markdown Article](/content/2b565a977d2e6a2f18b7959b463bf6e8c351e85b8c1ae3372ba9b9dc1425100ai0)  

Or [A Cypherpunk's Manifesto](/content/8cb9a7f93677cc17a9f15acdd36ff368bf4efbf9cba6b77922c401f137e38025i0)

Or to a [Scientific Publication](/content/1c0b64446e141c3542cd4dbd0da305ec61d80c14721482f76dfe22b692de3e03i0)

I can even create markdown content on chain with the [Cypherpunk Markdown Editor](/content/12392618ff20348a110504fb06da5996ca844c7c3b69bfcf4ba0cc74ef310f82i0)

With parent child I can create a signature as an author to demonstrate provenance and authenticity of all my work. 

Oh yeah, and this is all onchain. On Bitcoin. Forever. 

Remind me again why markdown sucks?
